    ### Customer Reviews
    ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ **"Absolutely stunning!"**  
    _Reviewed by Sarah M., April 2025_  
    This sofa is the centerpiece of my living room! The emerald green color pops, and the velvet feels so luxurious. It’s super comfortable, and my guests always compliment it. Assembly was a breeze, and delivery was quick. Highly recommend!

    ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ **"Great, but minor issue"**
    _Reviewed by James T., May 2025_
    Love the design and comfort, but one of the legs arrived slightly scratched. Customer service was quick to send a replacement, and now it’s perfect. The navy blue is elegant, and it fits my small apartment well.
