<Lead>A reusable UI kit for e-commerce platforms.</Lead>

## Challenge

Designing a flexible and consistent UI system for various e-commerce needs.

## Solution

Created modular components and documented usage for easy integration into any e-commerce project.

This e-commerce platform provides businesses with a complete solution for selling products online. The platform includes product management, inventory tracking, shopping cart functionality, secure checkout process, and integration with multiple payment gateways.

## Key Features

- Responsive product catalog with filtering and search
- User authentication and profile management
- Shopping cart with persistent storage
- Checkout process with address validation
- Payment processing with Stripe and PayPal
- Order management and tracking
- Admin dashboard for inventory and order management

## Technical Implementation

The frontend was built using React with TypeScript, utilizing Context API for state management and React Router for navigation. The UI was designed using a custom component library based on Tailwind CSS, ensuring a consistent look and feel throughout the application.

For the backend, we used Node.js with Express, connecting to a MongoDB database for data storage. Authentication was implemented using JWT tokens, and payment processing was integrated through Stripe's API.

## Challenges Overcome

One of the significant challenges was optimizing the product catalog for performance, especially when dealing with a large number of products and filtering options. We implemented virtualized lists and pagination to ensure smooth scrolling and quick loading times.

Another challenge was creating a seamless checkout experience across different devices. We used a multi-step form with state persistence to allow users to continue their checkout process even if they switched devices or closed their browser.
