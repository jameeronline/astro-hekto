# Sample Markdown Document for Tailwind Typography

This document demonstrates the styling applied by the Tailwind CSS Typography plugin. It includes various Markdown elements to showcase the `prose` class styling.

## Introduction

The Tailwind CSS Typography plugin provides a set of `prose` classes to style HTML content generated from Markdown. It ensures consistent, beautiful typography for articles, blog posts, and other text-heavy content.

### Why Use Tailwind Typography?

- **Easy to apply**: Just add the `prose` class to a container element.
- **Customizable**: Modify colors, spacing, and more via Tailwind utilities or plugin configuration.
- **Responsive**: Automatically adjusts typography for different screen sizes.

## Text Elements

This paragraph contains **bold text**, _italic text_, and a [link to Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). You can also include `inline code` to highlight snippets. The plugin styles these elements with balanced spacing and typography.

### Headings

Headings from `h1` to `h6` are styled with appropriate font sizes and weights:

#### Subheading Example

This is an `h4` heading, which is smaller but still prominent.

##### Smaller Subheading

An `h5` heading for less important sections.

###### Tiny Subheading

An `h6` heading for the smallest level of hierarchy.

## Lists

### Unordered List

- First item with some text
- Second item with **bold** content
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item with a [link](#)

### Ordered List

1. Step one: Install Tailwind CSS
2. Step two: Add the Typography plugin
3. Step three: Apply the `prose` class
   1. Nested step
   2. Another nested step

## Blockquote

> This is a blockquote. It’s great for emphasizing quotes or important notes. The Tailwind Typography plugin adds a stylish border and padding to make it stand out.

## Code Blocks

Below is a sample code block:

```javascript
function example() {
  console.log("Hello, Tailwind Typography!");
  return true;
}
```

Inline code like `const x = 10;` is also styled differently from regular text.

## Tables

| Prose Class       | Applies default typography styles        |
| Responsive Design | Adjusts font sizes for screen sizes      |
| Customizable      | Extend with Tailwind utilities or config |

## Images

The Typography plugin doesn't style images directly, but you can add Tailwind classes manually to `<img>` tags in the rendered HTML for consistent styling.

## Conclusion

The Tailwind CSS Typography plugin makes it easy to style Markdown content with minimal effort. Apply the `prose` class to your container, and enjoy beautifully formatted text!
