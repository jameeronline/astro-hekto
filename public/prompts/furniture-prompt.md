Create a set of four photorealistic images of a [PRODUCT_NAME] for e-commerce use, displayed on a clean, plain white background. The images should include:

Main view: A front-facing, slightly angled perspective showing the entire [PRODUCT_NAME] with clear details, vibrant colors, and realistic textures, centered in the frame.
Side view: A precise side profile of the [PRODUCT_NAME], showcasing its shape and design details, aligned centrally with even lighting.
Top view: A top-down perspective of the [PRODUCT_NAME], highlighting its surface, patterns, and layout, perfectly centered.
Detailed view: A close-up view of a key feature of the [PRODUCT_NAME] (e.g., texture, stitching, material, or unique design element), emphasizing intricate details with sharp focus.
All images should have consistent soft, even lighting, no shadows, and a minimalist, professional aesthetic suitable for product catalogs. Ensure the [PRODUCT_NAME] is accurately represented with high-resolution details and realistic proportions.
